# GHUB

GHUB is a Python application with a graphical interface built using Tkinter. It allows you to browse directories, clone Git repositories, and run scripts. It is designed to work with three repositories: one containing XFCE themes, another containing configuration scripts, and a third with multimedia addons.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/R2r-S/ghub.git

cd ghub


## Usage

### Running from Source

To run the application from the source code, execute:

python3 ghub.py

### Running from Distribution

To run the application from the `dist` directory, navigate to the `dist` directory and run the application by clicking on the `ghub` executable:

cd dist

./ghub

Alternatively, you can simply double-click on the `ghub` executable in the `dist` directory using your file manager.
